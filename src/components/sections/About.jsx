                        Hello there! My name is Josh and I am a front-end software developer (and a sneaker enthusiast) from Southern California. My interest in web development began when I started exploring some modules on FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project out of curiosity. This ultimately set me on a path of continuous learning and growth in the exciting and ever-evolving field of web development.

                        As a web developer, I value sincerity and empathy and I take pride in having a resourceful and straightforward approach when problem solving. My core values of sincerity and empathy guide me to take a resourceful and straightforward approach when problem solving, and I thrive in collaborative environments that encourage open communication and diverse perspectives. In the long run, I aspire to drive meaningful change and inspire others to reach their full potential.
                    </p>
